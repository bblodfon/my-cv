Dear Sir/Madam,
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>During the course of a PhD life, you always search for opportunities to acquire more knowledge and practical experience that will help your work in a meaningful manner.
Sometimes it is also nice to try something different, something you might not be comfortable with, something exciting.
I was thus very intrigued when I learned about the opportunity to do an internship in a biotech company supported by Digital Life Norway.</p>
<p>My experience and interests lie in the areas of software programming, reproducible data analyses and data visualization.
I have worked with various technologies and tools (<em>R</em>, <em>Java</em> and <em>JavaScript</em> being my strong programming languages) from my undergraduate years as an electrical and computer engineer student up until today as a PhD candidate.
I worked for 2 years as a Linux Systems engineer and software tester in a telecommunications company which made me realize that I don’t just enjoy the technical knowledge that a position offers but also the everyday work challenges and responsibilities as well as the interaction with other people - understanding what is their passion, how they do their work, what I can learn from them and what I can give back.
At the end of the day what really matters (and the biggest challenge of them all) is to give concrete answers/solutions to the questions and problems that your colleagues have for years! If you achieve that, then that’s a true praise for me in any kind of work (academia or industry).</p>
<p>I believe that this industry internship is a great opportunity to broaden my horizon not only with regards to my technical expertise but also from a social point of view: meet new people, learn about new technologies and in the end experience something outside of my PhD as a fun side-quest!</p>

<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
